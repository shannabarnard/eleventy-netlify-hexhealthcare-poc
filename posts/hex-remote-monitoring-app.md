Providing clinical virtual monitoring for the symptoms of Covid-19 and better protection for vulnerable people in care homes and the community through an efficient and easy-to-use application.

## The need for a remote monitoring app

As the UK enters flu season, and further government pandemic restrictions are enforced across the country, the time could not be more apt for the broader introduction of remote monitoring of Covid-19 symptoms. HexTransforma Healthcare have introduced their latest innovation, an app – **Hex Remote Monitoring** – which is of direct benefit to all members of society, but in particular those who are required to shield (2.2 million in England alone) and residents in care homes, of whom there are nearly half a million.

By removing the need for at-risk people to physically travel and visit clinicians for tests, diagnosis and treatment plans, patients will receive first-rate, tailored care which allows them to self-monitor and then share the data directly to their GP or local hospital through a direct interface with the Electronic Health Record. This will ensure that vulnerable people, in particular those who are shielding, do not feel isolated or that they are unable to receive proper care during this critical phase of the pandemic.

**Jean-Luc Bressard, CEO at HexTransforma Healthcare, says:** *“Remote monitoring and the creation of virtual wards is only one of the tools that the country has to fight the pandemic, but we believe that increasingly over time, it will prove to be essential and the data collected invaluable to the brave clinicians on the front line fighting this disease.”*

## How the Hex Remote Monitoring app works

Mental health experts have stated that another prolonged lockdown will have devastating effects on the mental health of thousands of Britons. The will be particularly acute for those who are having to shield during the pandemic as well as those who may feel cut-off. By providing this interoperable system where patients can feel safe and cared for, this will prevent in the exacerbation of further mental health decline and build towards a better health-oriented future.

**Stuart Hewitson, Head of Data and Analysis at HexTransforma Healthcare, says:** *“AI within Hex Remote Monitoring is about augmenting the clinician – allowing for more intelligent decision making and triage of patients in a virtual ward setting. The clinician is always in control and has the final decision; the AI is there to assist them in these unprecedented and challenging times. As we work with our academic partners to further understand the impacts of Covid-19 within the broader healthcare context we will continue to enhance the capabilities and reach to ultimately benefit patients and clinicians in a tangible way.”*
